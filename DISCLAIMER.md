All claims, content, designs, algorithms, estimates, roadmaps, specifications, and performance measurements described in this project are done with the Metaplex Foundationâ€™s ("MF") best efforts. It is up to the reader to check and validate their accuracy and truthfulness. Furthermore nothing in this project constitutes a solicitation for investment.
Any content produced by MF or developer resources that MF provides, are for educational and inspiration purposes only. MF does not encourage, induce or sanction the deployment, integration or use of any such applications in violation of applicable laws or regulations and hereby prohibits any such deployment, integration or use. This includes use of any such applications by the reader (a) in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction, (b) if the reader is located in or ordinarily resident in a country or territory subject to comprehensive sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), or (c) if the reader is or is working on behalf of a Specially Designated National (SDN) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions.
The reader should be aware that U.S. export control and sanctions laws prohibit U.S. persons (and other persons that are subject to such laws) from transacting with persons in certain countries and territories or that are on the SDN list. It is possible that such sanctioned persons may nevertheless bypass prohibitions, obtain the code comprising the Metaplex protocol (or other project code or applications) and deploy, integrate, or otherwise use it. Accordingly, there is a risk to individuals that other persons using the Metaplex protocol may be sanctioned persons and that transactions with such persons would be a violation of U.S. export controls and sanctions law. This risk applies to individuals, organizations, and other ecosystem participants that deploy, integrate, or use the Metaplex protocol code directly (e.g., as a node operator) or indirectly.
