# Metaplex Foundation Project Directory
This repository is a directory of the projects that the Metaplex Foundation works on. 

To learn more, visit our documentation at https://docs.metaplex.com.

## Rust Programs
- **The Metaplex Program Library** - [GitHub](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex-program-library)

  A collection of all the Solana programs that the Metaplex Foundation actively maintains. Each program is published to https://crates.io.


## SDKs
These high level SDKs make it a breeze to interact with our programs.
- **JavaScript SDK** - [GitHub](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/js) / [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metaplex-foundation/js)
  
  Our JS SDK is a high level SDK for interacting with our programs and was built on top of our autogenerated libraries. It currently still in active development.


- **iOS SDK** - [GitHub](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex-ios)

  Our new iOS SDK is built from scratch in Swift to provide a smooth experience for interacting with NFTs. It uses a similar interface to our JS SDK.


- **Android SDK** - [GitHub](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex-android)

  Our Android SDK was implemented from scratch in native Kotlin and is being developed in parallel with our iOS SDK. Like the iOS SDK, it also features a similar interface to our JS SDK. 


## Autogenerated Libraries
The following libraries were autogenerated by [Solita](#Solita). A link to each Rust crate on Crates.io is also provided for convenience. 
- **MPL Token Metadata** - [GitHub](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex-program-library/tree/master/token-metadata/js) / [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metaplex-foundation/mpl-token-metadata) / [Crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/mpl-token-metadata)

  The MPL Token Metadata program allows SPL tokens to add metadata to it and is one of the most important programs when dealing with NFTs on the Solana blockchain.


- **MPL Auction House** - [GitHub](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex-program-library/tree/master/auction-house/js) / [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metaplex-foundation/mpl-auction-house) / [Crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/mpl-auction-house)

  The MPL Auction House program is a protocol for marketplaces to implement a decentralized sales contract. It additionally allows for escrowless sales where the NFT doesn't leave the seller's wallet until the sale is complete.


- **MPL Candy Machine** - [GitHub](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex-program-library/tree/master/candy-machine/js) / [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metaplex-foundation/mpl-candy-machine) / [Crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/mpl-candy-machine)

  The MPL Candy Machine program enables creators to easily and safely launch NFT collections without having to worry about the rent overhead from minting the NFTs themselves.



## Tools
- **Sugar, the Candy Machine CLI** - [GitHub](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/sugar) 

  Sugar is our new Candy Machine CLI, built in rust. It is incredibly fast and easy to use.


- **Shank** - [GitHub](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/shank)

  Shank is a tool that makes IDLs from native Solana programs.

- **Solita** - [GitHub](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/solita)

  Solita (**SOL**ana **I**dl **T**o **A**pi) converts IDLs generated by *Shank* into JavaScript SDKs.


- **Amman** - [GitHub](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/amman)

  Amman, and the [Amman Explorer](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/amman-explorer) are a set of testing tools that make it easy to test Solana programs locally and see the changed deserialized states in real time on the explorer.


## UIs
- **Candy Machine UI** - [GitHub](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/candy-machine-ui)

  A reference minting UI for Candy Machine projects.


- **Gumdrop** - [GitHub](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/gumdrop)

  The Gumdrop UI and CLI for managing inexpensive SPL token and NFT airdrops.


- **Token Entangler UI** - [GitHub](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/token-entangler-ui)

  The Token Entangler UI that aims to help de-rug projects.

The following repositories are no longer maintained by the Metaplex Foundation.
- **Storefront** - [GitHub](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/deprecated-storefront)

  The deprecated Metaplex Storefront frontend for self-hosted NFT marketplaces.


- **Deprecated JavaScript CLIs** - [GitHub](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/deprecated-clis)

  A collection of JS CLIs that are no longer maintained by the Metaplex Foundation.
  
- **The Program Graveyard** - [GitHub](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/the-graveyard)
