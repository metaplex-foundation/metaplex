          'In 1982, Fujifilm hired world-renowned sports photographer Walter Iooss, Jr., to document the American athletes training for the 1984 Olympic games using Fuji\'s first-ever film, Fujichrome. For two years, Walter embedded himself with the Olympic athletes as they trained for and competed in the Los Angeles games. This project yielded groundbreaking work for the world of photography and exposed the industry to a new film that, thanks to this project, would go on to take market share away from Kodak. At the start of the Olympic games, you would only see empty yellow Kodak film boxes littering the sidelines. By the end of the games, you only saw green Fujifilm boxes. As Walter says, "It was a new species of film."',
          'This project culminated in an award-winning book and traveling exhibit entitled, Shooting for the Gold. Already a name in the industry, this project was a turning point for Iooss and would catapult him to new heights. In the years after, Iooss would shoot some of the most iconic photographs of Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Tiger Woods, and so many other iconic athletes and events.',
          'Now, in 2021, Solana is poised to become the new “green box” on the sidelines, breaking ground with their innovative blockchain and NFT platform Metaplex. To honor this moment and celebrate the closing of the 2021 Olympics, Immutable Image is releasing these images as our debut drop on the Metaplex network. Immutable Image is dedicated to bringing the best of photography directly from the artist onto the blockchain, and no better images than these to kick the whole thing off!',
          'Almost forty years ago, this series helped to change color photography. Forty years from now, will this drop be remembered as the NFTs that helped usher in the very best of photography in this new space? We hope so and we hope you’ll enjoy this exhibition and drop as we all Shoot for the Gold.',

What’s important to me is not to be understood, but to provide realizations. It doesn’t have to be life-changing, it could just initiate a simple feeling and I would be content.',
